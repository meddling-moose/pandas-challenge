# pandas-challenge

This challenge was more difficult for me than the last few challenges, mostly because this is the first we are venturing outside of my previous knowledge, and also because I wasn't able to pay as much attention to the material taught in class. That being said, I got help from TA's when necessary and I learned a lot. As such, instead of walking through the relatively short lines of code that dot this assignment, I'll go over my strategy in brief and then share a couple things I learned.

My strategy as usual was to pseudocode with comments and then break those down into code. However, because we started with starter code that was largely commented already, I didn't have to do very much before starting on the coding. Using Jupyter notebooks is also incredibly sequential, so I didn't need to plan very far ahead. This was nice and linear, but in a sense, different from before.

I learned two main lessons when working with pandas in this assignment.
1. save all dataframes I create so I can use them later, and go back and use those simpler dataframes when constructing more complex ones.

I got stuck a couple of times trying to make really complicated method chains before realizing I already had the data available in the first place, in a separate variable.

2. I don't need to use dataframes for everything, sometimes using simple variables that hold sums and totals will suit my needs just fine. I don't need to use a df to get that number when I can already use it as a number.

This one sounds silly, but again, to me it was hard.

3. I need to practice this more.

The reason why a lot of the other assignments have been so easy is because I have a lot of practice, but with pandas, I have very little practice. If I want to get better with this tool, I'm going to need to use it more.

As usual, for my data, I received it from my course materials specifically, the starter material for this challenge.
